        <h1>Summary about me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jessica Dai! I'm currently in college studying for graphic design, and just someone who wants to get by in life. 
            I usually come up with a lot of ideas in my head, but I don't always write them down, so I usually forget some. I think about these ideas a lot.
             I hope to be a graphic designer in the future, or at the very least something related to media arts.</p>
